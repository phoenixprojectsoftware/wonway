# **WELCOME TO WONway**

**WONway** is your gateway to everything *Half-Life WON.* From multiplayer access, to sounds, and to mods, this is every WON fan's heaven.

# **PHASE ONE â€” GET INSTALLED**
First, you need to get your WON games installed. So, grab your Half-Life big boxes, or the HL1 Anthology if that's your thing, and let's get started!
## **1.1. INSTALL HALF-LIFE**
We're just going to install the base game first. Most things you will install for pre-Steam GoldSource will requre Half-Life's `valve` folder as a
base, so you may aswell get that sorted. You can use either the original version of the Game of the Year Edition. 
We recommend leaving the installer on the default path, and leaving the network settings the same at the end.

When (or if) required, enter your CD Key.
## **1.2. INSTALL EXPANSIONS & MODS**
It's time to install your expansions & mods. Yep, all of them.
